Naming and Structure
• Namespace: LB.TweenHelper for all runtime and editor code.
• Class Names: Clear and complete.
• Method Names: Verb-based and explicit.
• No abbreviations or unclear short terms.
• File Names: Match class names exactly. One public class per file.

API Design
• Keep the public interface intention-revealing and minimal.
• Provide sensible defaults from Settings; allow explicit per-call overrides via the Options object.
• Always return the underlying DoTween Tween or Sequence.

Parameters and Overloads
• For duration: an optional explicit float duration parameter; if null, use Settings default.
• For overrides: accept an optional TweenOptions options parameter.

Documentation and Comments
• XML documentation on all public types and members.
• Inline comments only for non-obvious logic.

Error Handling and Guardrails
• Validate inputs early.
• Fail fast with clear, actionable log messages.

Dependencies and Boundaries
• Runtime code must not depend on editor assemblies.

Extensibility
• Presets: open registry.
• Options object: additive, not breaking.

Consistency
• Use the same defaults everywhere by pulling from Settings.
