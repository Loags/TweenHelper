Objective
Implement LB.TweenHelper in a strictly prioritized order, focusing on user-visible value first, then reuse and power features, then polish and diagnostics.

Order of Implementation
1) Settings and Bootstrap (single source of truth)
2) DoTween Integration (central configuration)
3) Lifecycle Tracking (safety fallback)
4) Public Interface (core one-liners)
5) Options Object (per-call overrides)
6) Preset System (reusable animations)
7) Sequence Composition (readable multi-step flows)
8) Control Surface (operational control)
9) Async Helpers (integration with async flows)
10) Diagnostics and Performance (polish and safety)
