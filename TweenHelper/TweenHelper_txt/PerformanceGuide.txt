Goals
• Keep steady-state animation at zero avoidable allocations.
• Avoid leaks and dangling tweens.
• Provide predictable frame time under load.

Engine Configuration
• Initialize DoTween once at startup.
• Set capacities to avoid internal array resizes.
• Optionally prewarm by creating and killing small tweens.

Allocation Strategy
• Use the Integration layer to apply options without allocating per frame.
• Avoid capturing large structs or references in per-frame delegates.

Linking and Cleanup
• Always link tweens to their GameObjects.
• Provide a Lifecycle Tracker fallback.

Update Strategy
• Choose sensible project defaults.

Snapping and Precision
• Use snapping only when necessary.

Materials, Rendering, and Text
• For SpriteRenderer fades, avoid re-creating materials.

Sequences and Batching
• Compose with sequences sparingly.

Capacities and IL2CPP
• Document recommended starting capacities.

Diagnostics and Profiling
• Provide a debug flag to label tweens.
• Offer a simple in-game counter.

Tuning Process
1) Start with Safe Mode on.
2) Profile heavy scenes.
3) Adjust capacities.
4) Reduce simultaneous starts.
5) Re-profile.
